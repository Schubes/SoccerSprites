# FootSim

A simple simulation of a soccer game. Install pygame and enjoy watching some
sprites attempt to play something resembling soccer. I welcome any suggestions to improve the quality of the gameplay.

To run main.py (the thing that makes most everything happen) you'll need python 2.7 and pygame installed.
